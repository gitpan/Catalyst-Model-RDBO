    * fix logic in _setup so that manager() can be overridden

0.03    19 April 2007
    * change _get_objects() to take HASH or ARRAY ref in addition to array.
    * change manager() to default to Rose::DB::Object::Manager if
      'manager' key not present in config().
    * POD clarifications.

0.04    22 May 2007
    * fix (dumb) error in _get_objects() in passing wrong array to $method.
      The error only manifests if you are using Rose::DB::Object::Manager
      directly, instead of your own *::Manager subclass.

0.05    21 June 2007
    * refactor fetch() and add new create() method.
    * fetch_all() and all() were doing exactly what search() does,
      so just aliased them to search().
    * use Catalyst::Exception instead of Carp and added throw_error()
      method to allow for easy overriding.
    
0.06    23 Oct 2007
    * added Catalyst::Exception to prereq list
    * updated license/copyright and included note about CatalystX::CRUD::Model::RDBO
